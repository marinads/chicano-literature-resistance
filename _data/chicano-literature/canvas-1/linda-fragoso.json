Chicano literature is a product of Chicanos. Some trace its historic roots to the blend of indian and Spanish heritage in the 15th century. Others say it goes back to the war between Mexico and the United States in the 1800s and many agreeing the Chicano literature first emerged full scale with the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s. Like all literature, there's trends within Chicano literature trends which reflect the economic, social and political situation of the times. Juan Rodriguez, a lecturer in English in the Center for Mexican American Studies in the University of Texas, teaches ethno literature and he's from the old guard of Chicano studies, he's the editor of Carta Abierta and publishes in Chicano literature. He'll discuss with us the development of Chicano literature. ",
